====================
 ROFLSCALE.buildout
====================

This is a buildout with some extra things thrown in it to help you get
a ROFLSCALE environment up and running quickly.

It was influenced by `typhoonae <http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/>`_ but meant to be more general.


What is a ROFLSCALE environment
===============================

`ROFLSCALE <http://youtu.be/majbJoD6fzo>`_ can be
`tehcnological masturbation <http://youtu.be/koGfmOOLjNU>`_ . But it's fashionable to use these tools
for all your projects, and in some cases it is quite
useful. Nonetheless, installing all these moving parts can waste
valuable time, so the intent of ROFLSCALE.buildout is to make that
easier. 


I just wrote this today, so there's not much beyond a proof of
concept. Obviously pull requests are welcome. :)
